2025-2 OSS 연습 레포지토리

### Hello, I am Junhyuk Park.
By taking this course, I aim to gain a good understanding of **OSS**, including **Python** and **Git**.
I'm very interested in **public transportation**, including :subway: and :bus:.
Therefore, after taking all my computer science classes, I'd like to develop a program that will make it easier to use the areas I'm interested in.
